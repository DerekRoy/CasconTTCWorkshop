Now you are in the notebook. First click on the vertically stacked dots on the top right of the screen, and click "Insert Project Token". Since you don't have one a dialogue will pop up. Clickk on the hyperlink to be taken to a new page. Here you just need to click create project token and give the token editing access. Now go back to your notebook and insert the project token. 


Now lets import the data into our project. By clicking the box that is made up of 1's and 0's in the top right corner. Then click on the one file in there, and click insert to pandas dataframe.
